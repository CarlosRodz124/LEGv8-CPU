# Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to study, via simulation, the performance of memory management policies and memory
configurations for cache memory systems. For the simulations, the trace files can be described below.

# Trace Files
The trace files have been generated on a PC. THe two programs traced have been stripped by removing cache hits
observed by a cache with 32 sets, 1-way associative, with 8 contiguous addressed per line.
